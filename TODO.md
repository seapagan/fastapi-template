# TODO List

## General

- add time-limited bans (configurable)
- Add certain users that will not time-expire (or much longer time) for eg for
  owner or premium access.
- Replace the `toml`/`toml_w` libraries with `rtoml` for better functionality.
  This is a Rust-based library that is very fast and very complete. It is also
  written by the same author as `pydantic` so should be a good fit.
- Add a `logout` route to immediately invalidate the users token and refresh
  token. This will need a database to be kept of invalidated tokens (which can
  periodically be auto-purged of tokens that would be time-expired anyway.)
- Allow to resend a registration email (part of the code is already there for
  this, but was not functioning properly so disabled).
- Send an email to the **User** when they change their password or update their
  profile, are Banned/Unbanned and to **Admins** when important events happen.
- Update current and future email templates with actual content, and change
  their markup to latest best practices.
- Add an option to the command line to bump the version number in API docs and
  the TOML file (can be done using the `poetry version` command already,
  document this).
- add verified status to user list for admins only.
- implement rate-limiting - auto block abusers - would help if `quotas`
  implemented first (see below).
- users should be able to get others (limited) profile data in some cases -
  public data should be ok (eg in a front-end profile page). Think about how
  this should be implemented. *This may just need to be in derived projects
  though, not this template*.
- add Metrics and Observability (eg Prometheus, Grafana, Sentry, etc)
- add pagination to the user list endpoint

## Auth

- add a password recovery endpoint
- Implement user groups and permissions, make it configurable.

## Testing

- fix all the tests that were broken by the recent changes to SQLAlchemy 2.0
  \[`done for the existing Unit tests, but not for the Integration tests`\]
- allow choice of Postgresql or SQLite for testing (currently only Postgresql)

## CLI

- option to remove the customization functionality from the CLI. Useful once you
  have customized the template and don't want to give the end-user the ability to
  change it easily.
- ctrl-c on the `custom metadata` command should not bring up a Rich
  stack-trace, but exit cleanly.
- add an option to make user an admin (or take it away)

## Documentation

- Add proper documentation with examples showing how to use the User & Auth
  system in custom code, link to example projects and perhaps create a YouTube
  video showing an example custom project based on this template?
- add commands to CLI to serve, build, publish to gh-pages etc

## Quotas

Add Quota functionality.

- limit number of API calls per user per day/hour
- different user groups have different quotas (configurable)
- allow endpoint with no Quota
- option to block altogether or seriously slow users access to the API for a
  period of time

## Caching

- add a Redis cache to the endpoints.
  [fastapi-redis-cache](https://pypi.org/project/fastapi-redis-cache/) should
  make this reasonably painless.

## Frontend

Add integration for a proper Frontend (ie React, Vue, etc) by having a config
value to point the the location of this instead of using the default
`templates/index.html`. Look at how to integrate API configuration values with
this front end.
