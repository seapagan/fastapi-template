# How to install this project

!!! info "Contribute!"
    If you make changes to the existing code, why not create a
    feature-branch and a Pull-Request to have it included into the Template? 😊

    See [Contributing](../../contributing) for more info.

## As a GitHub template

Click the 'Use this template' button at the top of the Repository on GitHub.
This will create a new repository in your personal GitHub account (Not a Fork)
which you can then Clone and start working on.

It is assumed that you have at least some knowledge of
[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/){:target="_blank"} to use this template,
there are very good
[Basic](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/){:target="_blank"} and
[Advanced](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/){:target="_blank"} User Guides
on the FastAPI website .

## As a Fork

You can also fork this project as usual, which allows you to easily bring it up
to date with changes and improvements as they happen. This does have the
posibility of conflicts. As long as you stick to adding new models and routes
but not modifying the existing base code it should be ok.

## Upgrading from a Patch file

Sometime in the next few releases I will include patch files with the release to
upgrade from the previous release. These can be applied by Git and will upgrade
the Template code to the latest. The same warning applies as above - your
changes can cause merge conflicts.

If you were a few releases behind, you can apply the patches in ascending
version order to get to the latest.
