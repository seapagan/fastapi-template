# Welcome to FastAPI-Template

!!! warning "ALPHA Status!"
    This documentation is currently **Alpha** status and I have much still to add.

## Features

This template is a ready-to-use boilerplate for a FastAPI project. It has the
following advantages to starting your own from scratch :

- Baked-in User database and management. Routes are provided to add/edit/delete
  or ban (and unban) Users.
- Postgresql Integration, using SQLAlchemy ORM, no need for raw SQL queries
  (unless you want to!). All database usage is Asynchronous.
  [Alembic](https://github.com/sqlalchemy/alembic) is used to control database
  migrations.
- Register and Login routes provided, both of which return a JWT token to be
  used in all future requests. JWT Token expires 120 minutes after issue.
- JWT-based security as a Bearer Token to control access to all your routes.
- A `Refresh Token` with 30 day expiry is sent at time of register or login
  (never again). This will enable easy re-authentication when the JWT expires
  without needing to send username or password again, and should be done
  automatically by the Front-End.
- A clean layout to help structure your project.
- **A command-line admin tool**. This allows to configure the project metadata
  very easily, add users (and make admin), and run a development server. This
  can easily be modified to add your own functionality (for example bulk add
  data) since it is based on the excellent
  [asyncclick](https://github.com/python-trio/asyncclick) library.
- Database and Secrets are automatically read from Environment variables or a
  `.env` file if that is provided.
- User email is validated for correct format on creation (however no checks are
  performed to ensure the email or domain actually exists).
- Control permitted CORS Origin through Environment variables.
- Manager class set up to send emails to users, and by default an email is sent
  when new users register. The content is set by a template (currently a
  basic placeholder). This email has a link for the user to confirm their email
  address - until this is done, the user cannot user the API.

The template **Requires Python 3.8.1+**

This template is free to use but I would request some accreditation. If you do
use it in one of your applications, please put a small note in your readme
stating that you based your project on this Template, with a link back to this
repository. Thank You ðŸ˜Š

For those who let me know they are using this Template, I'll add links back to
your project in this documentation.

## Funding Link

The template does include a `.github/FUNDING.yml` file which contains a link to
my [Buy Me A Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/seapagan) page. You can edit
or delete this as you will or replace with your own details. If you really
appreciate the Template, feel free to leave my details there in addition to your
own, though this is entirely optional ðŸ˜Š

The funding file allows your GitHub visitors to sponsor or tip you as a thanks
for your work.
