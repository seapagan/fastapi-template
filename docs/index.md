# Welcome to FastAPI-Template

![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/seapagan/fastapi-template)

A Configurable template for a FastAPI application, with Authentication and User
integration plus a CLI to manage the project.

It uses FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, Typer, and a few other libraries to
provide a ready-to-use boilerplate for a FastAPI project, with Async database
access.

!!! warning "BETA Docs!"

    This documentation is currently **Beta** status as it
    is still under active development. The in-depth Reference and Tutorial
    sections are not yet written.

!!! info "Version Refactor"

    This template versioning has been refactored to start from **Verison 0.4.0**
    . The original template was written for my own use and probably promoted to
    V 1.0.0 before it should have been, and there have been many updates and
    fixes since then.

    I will keep the old releases available for those who wish to use them (for
    a short time). I think it's better to do this now before there are more
    users who need to update their projects to future versions.

    All releases from now on will also contain a Git patch to upgrade from the
    previous version. This will be in the form of a `.patch` file which can be
    applied to their project using the `git apply` command. This will be
    documented in the release notes.

## Features

This template is a ready-to-use boilerplate for a FastAPI project. It has the
following advantages to starting your own from scratch :

- Baked-in User database and management. Routes are provided to add/edit/delete
  or ban (and unban) Users.
- Postgresql Integration, using SQLAlchemy ORM, no need for raw SQL queries
  (unless you want to!). All database usage is Asynchronous.
  [Alembic](https://github.com/sqlalchemy/alembic){:target="_blank"} is used to
  control database migrations.
- Register and Login routes provided, both of which return a JWT token to be
  used in all future requests. JWT Token expires 120 minutes after issue.
- JWT-based security as a Bearer Token to control access to all your routes.
- A `Refresh Token` with 30 day expiry is sent at time of register or login
  (never again). This will enable easy re-authentication when the JWT expires
  without needing to send username or password again, and should be done
  automatically by the Front-End.
- Full test coverage using `Pytest`.
- A clean layout to help structure your project.
- **A command-line admin tool**. This allows to configure the project metadata
  very easily, add users (and make admin), and run a development server. This
  can easily be modified to add your own functionality (for example bulk add
  data) since it is based on the excellent
  [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/){:target="_blank"} library.
- Database and Secrets are automatically read from Environment variables or a
  `.env` file if that is provided.
- User email is validated for correct format on creation (however no checks are
  performed to ensure the email or domain actually exists).
- Control permitted CORS Origin through Environment variables.
- Manager class set up to send emails to users, and by default an email is sent
  when new users register. The content is set by a template (currently a
  basic placeholder). This email has a link for the user to confirm their email
  address - until this is done, the user cannot user the API.
- Docker and Compose file set up to develop and test this API using Docker

The template **Requires Python 3.9+**

## Versioning

!!! warning "Beta Software!"

    This template is still in active development and may not yet ready for
    full production use. However, I am currently using it to develop my own
    projects, which include some production API's without issues. I will update
    the template as I find bugs or add new features. I will also be adding more
    documentation as I go.

This project uses [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/)

Given a version number `MAJOR`.`MINOR`.`PATCH`, increment the:

  1. `MAJOR` version when you make incompatible API changes
  2. `MINOR` version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
  3. `PATCH` version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions
to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
