# Contributing

Please **do** feel free to open an Issue for any bugs or issues you find, or
even a Pull Request with solutions ðŸ˜Ž

Likewise, I am very open to new feature Pull Requests!

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create a new Pull Request
