# Contributing

Please **do** feel free to open an Issue for any bugs or issues you find, or
even a Pull Request with solutions ðŸ˜Ž

Likewise, I am very open to new feature Pull Requests!

## GitHub Discussions

I have enabled
[Discussions](https://github.com/seapagan/fastapi-template/discussions) on this
repository, so if you have any questions, suggestions or just want to chat about
this template, please feel free to start a discussion.

## Install Git Pre-Commit hooks

Please do this if you are intending to submit a PR. It will check commits
locally before they are pushed up to the Repo.

```console
$ pre-commit install
pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

This will ensure that all code meets the required linting standard before being
committed.

## Run pre-commit manually

You can run these checks manually on all staged files using the below command :

```console
poe pre
```

## Update the Documentation if required

If you have added or changed functionality, please Update the documentation
also. **This is a pre-req to having a PR merged**. See
[Documentation](../development/documentation/) for instructions

## Ensure the tests Pass

Ensure that any new code has relevant PASSING Unit and (if applicable)
Integration Tests. New code should have full coverage and overall coverage
should not drop! See [Running Tests](../development/local/#run-tests) for more
information.

Note that there is a GitHub Action set up which will run all tests for each
commit that is pushed to the Repository.
