# The Base API Url. This is where your API wil be served from, and can be read

# http://localhost:8000

# Leave commented/unset to use the built-in password reset form.
# FRONTEND_URL=https://app.example.com

# The root path for the API. This is the path that the API will be served from,

# What to log - choose one or combine with commas:
#   ALL                    - Log everything (recommended for development/debugging)
#   NONE                   - Disable logging
#   REQUESTS               - HTTP request/response logging
#   AUTH                   - Authentication, login, token operations
#   DATABASE               - Database CRUD operations
#   EMAIL                  - Email sending operations
