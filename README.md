# FastAPI Application Template <!-- omit in toc -->

This is a template Repository for starting a new
[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) project with Authentication and Users,
with Authorization already baked-in.

Full documentation is now availiable on it's own page [here][doc]. Please visit
this for full usage information, how-to's and more.

## Functionality

This template is a ready-to-use boilerplate for a FastAPI project. It has the
following advantages to starting your own from scratch :

- Baked-in User database and management. Routes are provided to add/edit/delete
  or ban (and unban) Users.
- Postgresql Integration, using SQLAlchemy ORM, no need for raw SQL queries
  (unless you want to!). All database usage is Asynchronous.
  [Alembic](https://github.com/sqlalchemy/alembic) is used to control database
  migrations.
- Register and Login routes provided, both of which return a JWT token to be
  used in all future requests. JWT Token expires 120 minutes after issue.
- JWT-based security as a Bearer Token to control access to all your routes.
- A `Refresh Token` with 30 day expiry is sent at time of register or login
  (never again). This will enable easy re-authentication when the JWT expires
  without needing to send username or password again, and should be done
  automatically by the Front-End.
- A clean layout to help structure your project.
- **A command-line admin tool**. This allows to configure the project metadata
  very easily, add users (and make admin), and run a development server. This
  can easily be modified to add your own functionality (for example bulk add
  data) since it is based on the excellent
  [asyncclick](https://github.com/python-trio/asyncclick) library.
- Database and Secrets are automatically read from Environment variables or a
  `.env` file if that is provided.
- User email is validated for correct format on creation (however no checks are
  performed to ensure the email or domain actually exists).
- Control permitted CORS Origin through Environment variables.
- Manager class set up to send emails to users, and by default an email is sent
  when new users register. The content is set by a template (currently a
  basic placeholder). This email has a link for the user to confirm their email
  address - until this is done, the user cannot user the API.

The template **Requires Python 3.8.1+**

This template is free to use but I would request some accreditation. If you do
use it in one of your applications, please put a small note in your readme
stating that you based your project on this Template, with a link back to this
repository. Thank You ðŸ˜Š

For those who let me know they are using this Template, I'll add links back to
your project in this documentation.
