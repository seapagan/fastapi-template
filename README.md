This is a template Repository for starting a new
[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) project with Authentication and Users,
with Authorization already baked-in.

## Important note on Versioning

This template versioning has been refactored to start from **Verison 0.4.0**.

The original template was written for my own use and probably promoted to V1.0.0
before it should have been, and there have been many updates and fixes since
then.

I will keep the old releases available for those who wish to use them (for a
short time). It's better to do this now before more users need to update their
projects to future versions.

All releases from now on will also contain a Git patch to upgrade from the
previous version. This will be in the form of a `.patch` file which can be
applied to their project using the `git apply` command. This will be documented
in the release notes.

## Development Release

Actual development work is carried out on the
[`develop`](https://github.com/seapagan/fastapi-template/tree/develop) branch.
When it comes time for a non-alpha/beta release, the `develop` branch will be
merged into `main` and a new release will be made from there.

Check out the
[CHANGELOG](https://github.com/seapagan/fastapi-template/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md)
on that branch for details of what has changed since the last release.

The current development release is [Version
0.5.0-alpha2](https://github.com/seapagan/fastapi-template/releases/tag/v0.5.0-alpha2).
This is functional but still in development and may contain bugs. It is not
currently recommended for serious production use, though there are no known
issues at the moment. It is not fully backware compatible with previous
versions, if they have been customized.

## Functionality

This template is a ready-to-use boilerplate for a FastAPI project. It has the
following advantages to starting your own from scratch :

- Baked-in User database and management. Routes are provided to add/edit/delete
  or ban (and unban) Users.
- Postgresql Integration, using SQLAlchemy ORM, no need for raw SQL queries
  (unless you want to!). All database usage is Asynchronous.
  [Alembic](https://github.com/sqlalchemy/alembic) is used to control database
  migrations.
- Register and Login routes provided, both of which return a JWT token to be
  used in all future requests. JWT Token expires 120 minutes after issue.
- JWT-based security as a Bearer Token to control access to all your routes.
- A `Refresh Token` with 30 day expiry is sent at time of register or login
  (never again). This will enable easy re-authentication when the JWT expires
  without needing to send username or password again, and should be done
  automatically by the Front-End.
- A clean layout to help structure your project.
- **A command-line admin tool**. This allows to configure the project metadata
  very easily, add users (and make admin), and run a development server. This
  can easily be modified to add your own functionality (for example bulk add
  data) since it is based on the excellent
  [asyncclick](https://github.com/python-trio/asyncclick) library.
- Database and Secrets are automatically read from Environment variables or a
  `.env` file if that is provided.
- User email is validated for correct format on creation (however no checks are
  performed to ensure the email or domain actually exists).
- Control permitted CORS Origin through Environment variables.
- Manager class set up to send emails to users, and by default an email is sent
  when new users register. The content is set by a template (currently a
  basic placeholder). This email has a link for the user to confirm their email
  address - until this is done, the user cannot user the API.
- Docker and Compose file set up to develop and test this API using Docker

**This template is still in very active development and is not yet ready for
full production use. However, I am currently using it to develop my own
projects, which include some production API's without issues. I will update the
template as I find bugs or add new features. I will also be adding more
documentation as I go. For the moment, if you wish to use it without getting
involved in dev, I'd recommend checking out the latest actual
[Release](https://github.com/seapagan/fastapi-template/releases/latest).**

However, the `main` branch should be pretty stable as all development is done on
the `develop` branch and merged into `main` when ready.

The template **Requires Python 3.8.1+** or higher. It is developed under Python
3.11.

This template is free to use but I would request some accreditation. If you do
use it in one of your applications, please put a small note in your readme
stating that you based your project on this Template, with a link back to this
repository. Thank You ðŸ˜Š

For those who let me know they are using this Template, I'll add links back to
your project in this documentation.

## Installation

Click the 'Use this template' button at the top of the Repository on GitHub.
This will create a new repository in your personal GitHub account (Not a Fork)
which you can then Clone and start working on.

It is assumed that you have at least some knowledge of
[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) to use this template, there are very
good [Basic](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/) and
[Advanced](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/) User Guides on the FastAPI
website .

Visit our [Documentation Pages][doc] for usage, how-to's and more.

## Docker

### Develop on containers

> :warning: For local use rename `.env.example` to `.env`.

It is possible to develop directly on Docker containers :

**Using `docker compose up` (recommended):**

```console
docker compose up
```

To run and rebuild image (dependency updates):

```console
docker compose up --build
```

To remove all containers:

```console
docker compose down
```

**Using `docker compose run`:**

First run migrations:

```console
docker compose run --rm api alembic upgrade head
```

Run containers:

```console
docker compose run --rm --service-ports api uvicorn --host 0.0.0.0 main:app --reload
```

To rebuild image (dependency updates):

```console
docker compose build
```

### Migrations on containers

Running migrations on Docker container is also possible:

```console
docker compose run --rm api alembic upgrade head
```

### Testing on containers

Running tests on Docker container is also possible:

```console
docker compose run --rm api pytest
```

## Planned Functionality

See the [TODO.md](TODO.md) file for plans.

## Testing

**IMPORTANT : All tests are currently disabled on the `develop` branch until
they are properly re-written for async support. I expect to get the Unit tests
back quite soon, the integration tests will take a bit longer ðŸ˜”**

This project has a test suite for Integration and Unit tests. We use
[pytest](https://docs.pytest.org) for this.

Currently you need a Postgresql database running for this to work, however
SQLite support is planned to be re-added.

Before running the tests, you need to create a dedicated test database, in is
assumed that the server, username and password are the same as for the main
database.

Edit the setting in `.env` to point to the test database:

```ini
# Database name to use for testing. This must already exist.
TEST_DB_NAME=api-template-test
```

You can then migrate this empty database by running:

```console
$ ./api-admin test setup
Migrating the test database ... Done!
```

Tests can then be run from the checked out code with:

```console
$ pytest
```

It is possible to run either the Unit or Integration tests separately using
`pytest -m unit` or `pytest -m integration`

Full tests will be run automatically by **GitHub Actions** on every new commit
pushed up to the remote repository. Code Coverage is also checked and noted
after each test suite is run.

## Code Quality

`To be written`

## Known Bugs

See the [BUGS.md](BUGS.md) file for known bugs.

## Who is Using this Template?
